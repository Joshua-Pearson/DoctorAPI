<h2>This is a public API for doctors and insurance information in San Francisco, CA,
that I put together for my application <a>doctorsearch.herokuapp.com</a><a>https://github.com/Joshua-Pearson/DoctorSearch</a>. This API is hosted
for free to use as you see fit at <a>http://doctorstats.herokuapp.com/api/v1/</a><br>I'm still working on making
my API more easily searchable.</h2><h3>I started and finished this API as well as the project mentioned above, all in one week, for my final graduating project for 
www.generalassemb.ly </h3><h4>I started by using <a>www.import.io</a>, which is an fabulous piece of software, to scrape <a>www.healthpocket.com</a> 
for a basic list of doctors. However, I wasn't satisfied with the results which didn't seem completely accurate or up to date, 
so I decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own ruby scripts that required <a>https://github.com/watir/watir</a> or (<a>www.watir.com</a>) 
to scrape most of this information from <a>anthem.com</a> and <a>blueshieldca.com</a>. Special thanks to the Watir and Import.io people for making amazing products.</h4> 

<p>The reason I put this API together is that with the new Affordable Care Act I think it is paramount that people
are aware of the doctors available for their specific health plan before deciding on what insurance plan to buy.
Unfortunately the health care industry doesn't make this information easy to access, or have a public
API that would facilitate better apps than this. Please help me push for more transparency in 
the health care industry. Transparency is crucial, we need an API available to all in the health care industry.</p>

<p> This API, for the moment, only has data for the city of San Francisco and only has information for the 
  4 biggest insurance providers that participate in Covered California (California's Department for the Affordable Care Act).
  The companies are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Kaiser and Chinese Community Health Plan(CCHP). This API is searchable
  by doctor last name or by insurance provider. I would like to eventually include a much broader area and include every insurance provider, but this was not feasible
  given my time contraints and resources.</p>
