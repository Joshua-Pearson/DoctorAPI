<h2>This is a public API for doctors and insurance information in San Francisco, CA 
that I put together for my application <a>https://github.com/Joshua-Pearson/test_api</a>.<br></h2> 
<h3>I started and finished both of these in one week as my final graduating project for www.generalassemb.ly </h3>
<h4>I used <a>www.import.io</a> and www.healthpocket.com. Import.io was used for getting the data and Healthpocket for supplying it.</h4> 
<p>The reason I put this API together is that with the new Affordable Care Act I think it is paramount that people
are aware of what doctors are available before deciding on what insurance plan to buy.
Unfortunately the health care industry doesn't make this information easy to access, or have a public
API that would facilitate better apps than this. Please help me push for more transparency in 
the health care industry. Transparency is crucial, we need an API available to all in the health care industry.</p>

<p> This API, for the moment, only has data for the city of San Francisco and only has information for the 
  4 biggest insurance providers that participate in Covered California (California's Department for the Affordable Care Act).
  The companies are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Kaiser and Chinese Community Health Plan(CCHP). This API is searchable
  by doctor last name or by insurance provider. I would like to eventually include a much broader area and include every insurance provider, but this was not feasible
  given my time contraints and resources.</p>
<p>If you appreciate this work or would like help get a robust public health API started, please feel free to email me at joshua.david.pearson@gmail.com
