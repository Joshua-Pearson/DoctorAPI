<h2>This is a public API for doctors and insurance information in San Francisco, CA,
that I put together for my application <a>https://github.com/Joshua-Pearson/test_api</a>.<br></h2> 
<h3>I started and finished this API as well as the project mentioned above, all in one week, for my final graduating project for 
www.generalassemb.ly </h3><h4>I started by using <a>www.import.io</a> and <a>www.healthpocket.com</a> for a basic list of doctors. 
However, I wasn't satisfied with the results which didn't completely accurate or up to date, so I decided to make my own ruby script using 
<a>https://github.com/watir/watir</a> to scrape most of this information from <a>anthem.com</a> and <a>blueshieldca.com</a>. Special thanks
to the Watir people for making an amazing product. If anyone is interested in how I wrote these scripts, feel free to contact me. Import.io, which is a great piece of software,  
was used getting very basic data from Healthpocket.</h4> 
<p>The reason I put this API together is that with the new Affordable Care Act I think it is paramount that people
are aware of what doctors are available before deciding on what insurance plan to buy.
Unfortunately the health care industry doesn't make this information easy to access, or have a public
API that would facilitate better apps than this. Please help me push for more transparency in 
the health care industry. Transparency is crucial, we need an API available to all in the health care industry.</p>

<p> This API, for the moment, only has data for the city of San Francisco and only has information for the 
  4 biggest insurance providers that participate in Covered California (California's Department for the Affordable Care Act).
  The companies are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Kaiser and Chinese Community Health Plan(CCHP). This API is searchable
  by doctor last name or by insurance provider. I would like to eventually include a much broader area and include every insurance provider, but this was not feasible
  given my time contraints and resources.</p>
